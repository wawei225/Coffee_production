## Coffee Production Report

This is a directed-study under the supervision of Professor Kevin Schnepel. 
I drew insights from the large literature evaluating the economics of the wine industry that focuses on the causal determinants of quality and price. 
Specifically, I applied state-of-the-art econometric methodologies to perplex weather data, price, and coffee demand and delivered a comprehensive report.
